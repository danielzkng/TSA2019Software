Reply 2 (landerson) (1/11 18:38:53): Speaking of tonight's homework, can anyone help me with problem 10? I'm struggling on it right now.

Reply 3 (jtoth123) (18:42:54): Too bad i can't make it to this one, but ill be cheering in spirit

Reply 3 (wmoore)(in response to 2) (1/11 18:42:59): If you factor out x from the left side of the equation, you should be left with a quadratic that you know how to factor. Then use the null factor theorem to solve for x.
